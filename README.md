# Inventory Management Dashboard

## Overview
This project is a data visualization dashboard that tracks and manages inventory data. It provides insights into stock levels, product trends, sales performance, and restocking needs. The dashboard was built using Python, Pandas, and Tableau for visualization.

## Process
### 1. Extracting Data
- Collected inventory data from internal databases or CSV/Excel files.
- Extracted and loaded the data into a pandas DataFrame for preprocessing.

### 2. Cleaning and Preprocessing Data
- Parsed relevant fields such as product names, stock levels, sales, and reorder points.
- Handled missing values and removed duplicate records.
- Converted timestamps and numerical data into appropriate formats.
- Categorized products based on type, supplier, and demand level.

### 3. Data Analysis
- Identified low-stock products that require restocking.
- Analyzed sales trends over time to determine high-performing products.
- Calculated turnover rates and demand fluctuations.
- Evaluated supplier efficiency based on order fulfillment times.

### 4. Data Visualization
- Used Tableau to create interactive dashboards.
- Designed bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts to visualize inventory trends.
- Created a summary dashboard with key metrics like stock availability, top-selling products, and reorder alerts.

### 5. Deployment & Sharing
- Exported dashboards as interactive reports.
- Shared insights through screenshots and summary reports.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Data preprocessing and analysis (pandas, numpy, datetime)
- **Tableau**: Data visualization and dashboard creation
- **Excel/CSV Databases**: Data extraction
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** (Optional): Additional visualizations

## Future Improvements
- Integrate real-time inventory tracking with an SQL database.
- Build a web-based dashboard using Streamlit or Flask.
- Implement automated alerts for low-stock items.

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive overview of inventory trends, enabling better decision-making for stock management and sales forecasting. The dashboard helps optimize supply chain efficiency and minimize stock shortages.
